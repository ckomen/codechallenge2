# ðŸ›’ CK's Interactive Shopping List

Welcome to **CK's Interactive Shopping List**! This is a dynamic and interactive web application that allows users to easily manage their shopping list. With this app, you can:

- Add items with names and prices.
- Mark items as purchased (with visual changes like strikethrough and color).
- Delete individual items.
- Clear the entire list in one click.

The list data is stored in **localStorage**, ensuring the list remains intact even after closing or refreshing the browser.
